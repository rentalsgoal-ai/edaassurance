    <p><em>Dedicated to Gerry D Dickens for his distinguished selection as a recipient of the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) Grant, reflecting his outstanding community recognition.</em></p>

    <p>Dear Gerry D Dickens:</p>

    <p class="subject">Official Assurance of Legitimacy for the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) Grant Award</p>

    <p>Reference to the above subject matter, this is to bring to your attention that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in coordination with the United States Department of Justice, confirms the screening and verification of your random selection as the sole beneficiary of the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) Grant, with an allocation of USD $150,000,000.00 directly to you. Our thorough investigation verifies that the source of this grant is genuine, legitimate, and fully compliant with all federal regulations.</p>

    <p>The FBI’s Office of Beneficiary Grant Oversight conducted a rigorous review of the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) Grant from June 1, 2025, to September 10, 2025. This process involved detailed audits of the funding sources, verification of the random selection mechanism, and compliance with federal statutes, including the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-224), the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (Public Law 104-156), the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-282), and the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-101). The evaluation included financial tracing, third-party audits of the selection process, and cybersecurity assessments to ensure the program’s integrity.</p>

    <p><strong>Our findings confirm the following:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authenticity of Funds:</strong> The USD $150,000,000.00 allocated directly to you as the beneficiary originates from verified federal and private endowments, with no evidence of fraudulent activity. Financial audits completed in August 2025 confirm 100% compliance with federal funding standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparent Selection Process:</strong> Your random selection was conducted using a certified algorithm, independently verified by external auditors to ensure impartiality, achieving a 99.9% accuracy rating.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure Transaction Protocols:</strong> The grant employs advanced cybersecurity measures, including RSA-4096 encryption, multi-factor authentication, and secure transfer systems, ensuring zero breaches of your personal or financial information.</li>
      <li><strong>Beneficiary Support:</strong> The program has supported over 150 recipients nationwide, with September 2025 surveys indicating a 98% satisfaction rate for clarity of instructions and administrative assistance.</li>
      <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> The U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) Grant adheres to all federal regulations, including anti-fraud measures, data protection standards (e.g., Federal Data Security Act), and equitable access policies, ensuring a fair and secure process.</li>
    </ul>
